addBlock([String:Texture/Texture:texture])
Draws a ghost block in your world!
See the full help doc for examples.

WorldHudItem functions:
    destroy()  --stops it from drawing, also replaces all the controls with false
    setPos(Number:x, Number:y, Number:z) --move the item
    setX(Number:x)  --set the items's x pos
    setY(Number:y)  --set the items's y pos
    setZ(Number:z)  --set the items's z pos
    setRot(Number:yaw, Number:pitch, Number:roll)  --this one doesnt work for holoBlock yet D:
    setOpacity(Number:amount)  --set the items's opacity
    getOpacity()    --get the current opacity
    getPos()        --returns the pos of the item (x,y,z = hb.getPos())
    getRot()        --like getPos(), but for rotation
    enableDraw([Boolean:state]) --set weather or not to draw this item
    disableDraw()   --basicly just enableDraw(false)
    isDrawing()     --checks if enableDraw is true
    xray([Boolean:state])   --Set weather or not to use xray mode when drawing
Block functions:
    setWidth(Number:width)  change the size of the holoBlock
    changeTexture(String:texture)  change the texture of the holoBlock
    setUV(Number:uMin, Number:vMin, Number:uMax, Number:vMax) change where
                the texture is sampled from in the picture, these are always 0 thru 1
                textures will tile outside those ranges
    overlay()   quickly sets the width to about 1.0001 so its just larger than a block

Texture types:
    starts with
      "web:" followed by the url to an image, this isn't set up yet
      "resource:" uses a resource from this mod
      "minecraft:blocks" the texture with most of the items crammed onto it 
      (256x256 pixels and 32x32 items/blocks)
      ""  starts with nothing, this will use a file address anywhere 
          on your computer (like "C://users/username/pictures/untitled.png")
Tips:
    if you want to make a guide block, use set the width slightly
    smaller than the block, otherwise they may render with the textures
    overlapping
    (Example: hb.setWidth(.999))
    
    You can make an animated texture by putting all the frames in one image
    and using the UV coordinates to change which frame is being shown
    
Example:
  local x,y,z = player.getBlockPos()
  clearWorldHud()               --remove any existing worldHudItems
  local hb = addHoloBlock()     --create the holoblock
  hb.setPos(x,y,z)              --move where the holoblock will be drawn
  hb.setOpacity(.7)             --can make it a bit transparent
  hb.xray()                     --make it so it is rendered over everything
  --hb.xray(false) to disable
  --hb.xray(true) also works to enable it
  
  --**IMPORTANT**
  hb.enableDraw()               --allow this hudItem to be drawn
  --hb.enableDraw(true) is the same
  --hb.enableDraw(false) will hide the holoBlock

Planed features:
  setColor(Int/RGB) tint the block to some color, like the grass does
  setRot() this isn't setup yet
